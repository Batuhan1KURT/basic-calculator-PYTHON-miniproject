#Description


Dive into the world of Python programming with this interactive mini-project - the Basic Calculator. This project offers a hands-on experience in creating a command-line calculator capable of handling essential arithmetic operations. Whether you're a beginner seeking to strengthen your Python skills or an enthusiast looking for a quick coding challenge, this mini-project is designed to enhance your understanding of user interfaces, input parsing, calculations, and error handling.



#TO-DO


1.) User Interface: Create a basic command-line interface (CLI) for the calculator where users can enter mathematical expressions.

2.) Basic Operations: Implement four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

3.) Input: Allow users to input mathematical expressions as strings (e.g., "2 + 3", "4 * 5").

4.) Parsing: Parse the input expression to extract the two operands and the operator.

5.) Calculations: Perform the appropriate calculation based on the operator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).

6.) Display Result: Display the result of the calculation to the user.

7.) Error Handling: Handle potential errors, such as division by zero or invalid input.

8.) Loop: Allow the user to perform multiple calculations in a loop until they choose to exit.

9.) User-Friendly Messages: Provide clear and user-friendly messages to guide the user through the calculator.

10.) Documentation: Include comments in your code to explain the purpose of functions and any complex logic.

11.) Testing: Test your calculator with various input expressions to ensure it performs calculations correctly and handles errors gracefully.
